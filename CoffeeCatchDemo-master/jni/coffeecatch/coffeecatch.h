/* CoffeeCatch, a tiny native signal handler/catcher for JNI code.
 * (especially for Android/Dalvik)
 *

 * See the "License" section below for the licensing terms.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * Allows to "gracefully" recover from a signal (segv, sibus...) as if it was
 * a Java exception. It will not gracefully recover from allocator/mutexes
 * corruption etc., however, but at least "most" gentle crashes (null pointer
 * dereferencing, integer division, stack overflow etc.) should be handled
 * without too much troubles.
 *
 * The handler is thread-safe, but client must have exclusive control on the
 * signal handlers (ie. the library is installing its own signal handlers on
 * top of the existing ones).
 *
 * You must build all your libraries with `-funwind-tables', to get proper
 * unwinding information on all binaries. On ARM, you may also use the
 * `--no-merge-exidx-entries` linker switch, to solve certain issues with
 * unwinding (the switch is possibly not needed anymore).
 * On Android, this can be achieved by using this line in the Android.mk file
 * in each library block:
 *   LOCAL_CFLAGS := -funwind-tables -Wl,--no-merge-exidx-entries
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * COFFEE_TRY() {
 *   call_some_native_function()
 * } COFFEE_CATCH() {
 *   const char*const message = coffeecatch_get_message();
 *   jclass cls = (*env)->FindClass(env, "java/lang/RuntimeException");
 *   (*env)->ThrowNew(env, cls, strdup(message));
 * } COFFEE_END();
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 * Currently the library is installing both alternate stack and signal
 * handlers for known signals (SIGABRT, SIGILL, SIGTRAP, SIGBUS, SIGFPE,
 * SIGSEGV, SIGSTKFLT), and is using sigsetjmp()/siglongjmp() to return to
 * "userland" (compared to signal handler context). As a security, an alarm
 * is started as soon as a fatal signal is detected (ie. not something the
 * JVM will handle) to kill the process after a grace period. Be sure your
 * program will exit quickly after the error is caught, or call alarm(0)
 * to cancel the pending time-bomb.
 * The signal handlers had to be written with caution, because the virtual
 * machine might be using signals (including SEGV) to handle JIT compiler,
 * and some clever optimizations (such as NullPointerException handling)
 * We are using several signal-unsafe functions, namely:
 * - siglongjmp() to return to userland
 * - pthread_getspecific() to get thread-specific setup

/**
 * Setup crash handler to enter in a protected section. If a recognized signal
 * is received in this section, the execution will be diverted to the
 * COFFEE_CATCH() block.
 *
 * Note: you MUST use the following pattern when using this macro:
 * COFFEE_TRY() {
 *   .. protected section without exit point
 * } COFFEE_CATCH() {
 *   .. handler section without exit point
 * } COFFEE_END();
 *
 * You can not exit the protected section block, or the handler section block,
 * using statements such as "return", because the cleanup code would not be
 * executed.
 *
 * It is advised to enclose this complete try/catch/end block in a dedicated
 * function declared extern or __attribute__ ((noinline)).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * void my_native_function(JNIEnv* env, jobject object, jint *retcode) {
 *   COFFEE_TRY() {
 *     *retcode = call_dangerous_function(env, object);
 *   } COFFEE_CATCH() {
 *     const char*const message = coffeecatch_get_message();
 *     jclass cls = (*env)->FindClass(env, "java/lang/RuntimeException");
 *     (*env)->ThrowNew(env, cls, strdup(message));
 *     *retcode = -1;
 *   } COFFEE_END();
 * }
 *
 * In addition, the following restrictions MUST be followed:
 * - the function must be declared extern, or with the special attribute
 *   __attribute__ ((noinline)).
 * - you must not use local variables before the complete try/catch/end block,
 *   or define them as "volatile".
 * - your function should not ignore the crash silently, as the library will
 *   ensure the process is killed after a grace period (typically 30s) to
 *   prevent any deadlock that may occur if the crash was caught inside a
 *   non-signal-safe function, for example (such as malloc()).
